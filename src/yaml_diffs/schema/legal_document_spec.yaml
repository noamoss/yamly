      Recursive section definition. Sections can contain nested sections
      to unlimited depth. Each section must have a marker for diffing.
      Section IDs are optional and will be auto-generated if not provided.
      Markers are the primary identifiers used for matching sections across
      document versions.

      id:
        type: string
        description: |
          Optional stable section identifier. If not provided, a UUID will be
          auto-generated. Used for tracking sections across document versions.
          Pattern supports alphanumeric characters, hyphens, and underscores.
          This allows for UUIDs (e.g., "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000")
          as well as custom identifiers (e.g., "sec-1", "sec-1-a").

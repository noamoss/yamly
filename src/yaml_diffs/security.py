"""Security utilities for path validation.

This module provides path validation functions to prevent directory traversal
attacks and restrict file access to specific directories. These utilities are
designed for API security contexts where user-provided file paths need to be
validated before file operations.

    """Validate that a file path is safe and doesn't contain directory traversal.

    This function validates file paths to prevent directory traversal attacks
    (e.g., `../../../etc/passwd`). It can optionally restrict paths to a base
    directory for API security contexts.

    The validation:
    - Checks for directory traversal sequences (`..`)
    - Resolves symlinks to detect symlink-based attacks
    - Optionally restricts paths to a base directory
    - Normalizes paths to handle edge cases

    Args:
        file_path: Path to validate (string or Path object).
        base_dir: Optional base directory to restrict paths to. If provided,
            all paths must be within this directory. If None, only directory
            traversal is checked.

    Returns:
        Resolved, validated Path object.

    Raises:
        PathValidationError: If the path is unsafe. Reasons include:
            - "directory_traversal": Path contains `..` sequences
            - "outside_base_dir": Path resolves outside base_dir

    Examples:
        >>> from pathlib import Path
        >>> validate_path_safe("documents/file.yaml")
        Path('documents/file.yaml')

        >>> base = Path("/safe/directory")
        >>> validate_path_safe("file.yaml", base_dir=base)
        Path('/safe/directory/file.yaml')
